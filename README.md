## Features

- 🖥 **Built-in web UI** — served by the backend itself (no build step): Login, Dashboard, Hardware Inventory (bulk actions, QR codes, global search), Employee Directory with per-employee device history, Handover basket with **printable receipt**, software (license) assignment, Licenses, Consumables, Maintenance and IT User management with login auditing. Open `http://localhost:8000` after starting.
- 🚀 **First-run onboarding** — set company name, logo and the Admin account on first launch; branding is applied across the UI and the printed handover forms (change later via Settings).
- 🧪 **Demo dataset** — `npm run seed:demo` fills a postgres instance with a realistic 500-employee company (773 assets, receipts, audit history, software assignments) for evaluation.
- 🔐 **Role-based access control** — `Owner`, `Admin`, `Helpdesk`, `Viewer` roles enforced on every endpoint
- 💻 **Hardware inventory** — asset tags (unique, QR-encoded), serials, MAC addresses, specs, warranty
- 🤝 **Atomic handover basket** — assign multiple assets to an employee in one all-or-nothing transaction, producing a printable handover receipt (Zimmet Tutanağı)
- 🛠 **Maintenance lifecycle** — send to repair / return / scrap, with the pre-repair assignment state restored automatically
- 📄 **Software licenses** — seat pools with atomic claim/release and 30-day expiry alerts
- 📦 **Consumables** — stock movements with low-stock alerts
- 📊 **Dashboard aggregates** — asset counts by status, alerts, recent handover activity
- 🧾 **Full audit trail** — every assign/return/repair/progress-note is logged with who/when/why; per-user login history
- ⏳ **Product lifecycle management** — set a lifecycle duration (months) per category once in Settings; every asset shows its EOL date, "EOL soon"/overdue flags in inventory, and lifecycle reports
- 📈 **Reports & Custom Report Builder** — six preset reports plus a builder (7 data sources × selectable columns × filters), exported as Excel-friendly CSV or printed with company letterhead
- 🗂 **Product catalog** — centrally managed brand/model & spec lists per category feed the asset form dropdowns; asset tags are system-assigned and sequential
- 📁 **Document archive** — every handover form is auto-filed per employee; upload signed scans (stored securely in the database)

## Quick start — Docker Compose

Everything is automatic: the database container is created, the schema is
applied, and the first Admin (Owner) account is seeded.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/itacm.git
cd itacm

npm install
npm run setup          # generates .env with strong secrets (or copy .env.example)

docker compose up -d
docker compose logs api   # first-run Owner credentials are printed here
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** — the first visit shows the onboarding
wizard to set your company name/logo and create the **Owner** account.

> If you leave `ADMIN_PASSWORD` empty, a strong random password is generated and
> printed **once** in the API logs. Change it after first login.

Prefer to configure by hand? Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set at least
`JWT_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`), then `docker compose up -d`.

---

## Deploying to a server

The compose file works unchanged on any host with Docker. Put a reverse proxy
(Caddy/Nginx/Traefik) with TLS in front of port 8000 and set `CORS_ORIGINS` to
your frontend's origin if it differs.

For managed platforms (Railway, Render, Fly.io, Cloud Run…), deploy the
`Dockerfile`, attach a Postgres add-on, and set the same environment variables
(`DATABASE_URL`, `PGSSL=true`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_*`). The schema is applied
automatically on startup.

---

## Configuration reference

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | – | HTTP port (default `8000`) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | – | Comma-separated allowed origins (blank = same-origin) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` (or `POSTGRES_URL`) |
| `PGSSL` | – | `true` for managed Postgres over TLS |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Min 32 chars — `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | – | Token lifetime (default `12h`) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | – | First-run Owner seed (password auto-generated if empty) |

With docker compose, `POSTGRES_DB` / `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` feed
both the database container and the API's `DATABASE_URL`.

## API reference

All responses are `{ success, data }` or `{ success: false, error, details? }`.
All endpoints (except `login`/`health`) require `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`.

| Method | Endpoint | Roles | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | public | Email/password → JWT *(postgres mode)* |
| POST | `/api/auth/verify-token` | any | Validate token, return profile + permissions |
| GET/POST | `/api/auth/users` | Admin | List / create IT users |
| PUT | `/api/auth/users/:uid/role` | Admin | Change a user's role |
| GET | `/api/dashboard/stats` | all | Counts, low-stock & license alerts, recent activity |
| GET | `/api/assets` | all | Inventory list — `?status=&category=&search=` |
| GET | `/api/assets/:id` | all | Asset detail + audit history |
| POST / PUT | `/api/assets`, `/api/assets/:id` | Admin, Helpdesk | Create / update hardware |
| POST | `/api/assets/:id/return` | Admin, Helpdesk | Return an assigned asset to stock |
| POST | `/api/handovers` | Admin, Helpdesk | **Atomic handover basket** (below) |
| GET | `/api/handovers`, `/:id` | all | Receipts (feeds the printable form) |
| GET/POST | `/api/maintenance` | Admin, Helpdesk | Repair logs / send to repair |
| PUT | `/api/maintenance/:id/close` | Admin, Helpdesk | Close repair (`{scrap:true}` to scrap) |
| GET | `/api/employees` | all | Directory + handover employee selector |
| POST / PUT | `/api/employees` | Admin, Helpdesk | Create / update (deactivation blocked while assets held) |
| GET | `/api/licenses`, `/api/consumables` | all | Lists with alert flags |
| POST | `/api/licenses`, `/:id/seats` | Admin, Helpdesk | Create / atomic seat claim-release |
| POST | `/api/consumables`, `/:id/stock` | Admin, Helpdesk | Create / atomic stock movement |

### The atomic handover basket

```http
POST /api/handovers
{
  "employeeId": "…",
  "documentType": "single",
  "items": [
    { "assetId": "…", "conditionNote": "New, sealed box" },
    { "assetId": "…", "conditionNote": "Used, good condition" }
  ]
}
```

In **one transaction** (Firestore `runTransaction` / Postgres `BEGIN … FOR UPDATE`):
every asset is validated as `In Stock` → the receipt document is created →
each asset flips to `Assigned` bound to the employee → the employee's
`activeAssetCount` is incremented → one audit row is written per asset.
If **any** asset is locked, the API returns `409` with a per-asset conflict
list and **nothing is written**. Row locks / transaction retries make it
impossible for two operators to hand over the same laptop concurrently.

## Security notes

- **Secrets never live in the repo.** `.env` is git-ignored; the setup wizard
  writes it with `0600` permissions and generates a strong `JWT_SECRET` and DB
  password for you.
- **Auth:** passwords are bcrypt-hashed (cost 12); JWTs are signed HS256 with
  your ≥32-char secret; login uses a single error message for both unknown
  email and wrong password; every request re-checks the user row so role
  changes/deletions apply instantly.
- **Hardening:** strict Content-Security-Policy (no inline scripts, self-only), HSTS, nosniff/frame-deny/referrer/
  permissions-policy headers, login rate-limiting (20 attempts / 15 min / IP), global API rate limit
  (1000 req / 5 min / IP), same-origin-only CORS by default, 1MB body limit, `x-powered-by` disabled,
  one-shot onboarding endpoint that locks itself after first use, `npm audit`-clean dependency tree.
- **Transport:** front the API with HTTPS (Caddy/Nginx/Traefik on a VPS). Set
  `CORS_ORIGINS` to your exact frontend origin if it differs.
